# Privacy-Preserving Similarity Queries for Outsourced Trajectory Data

This repo is the implementation of our research paper, named "Privacy-Preserving Similarity Queries for outsourced Trajectory Data." 
In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving trajectory similarity query schemes for both top-k and range queries.

PTTSQ: a privacy-preserving **top-k** trajectory similarity query scheme

PTSRQ: a privacy-preserving trajectory similarity **range** query scheme


## Setup

This project is built upon python 3.8. The test dataset can be downloaded from:

(1) T-drive https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/

(2) Geolife  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/
